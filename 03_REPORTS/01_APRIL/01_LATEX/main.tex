\maketitle

The purpose of this report is to present the activities carried out during the month of April 2025, in the context of the Undergraduate Thesis.

\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Definition of the theme.}

The provisional theme defined for the work was ``A Stochastic Approach to the L80 Model''\footnote{Title subject to change}. The project is based on the study of the article by \citet{Chekroun2021};

\item \textbf{Bibliographic survey.}

The main theoretical references that will underpin the development of the work were identified and selected. All are available on the \textbf{Reference} page of the report;

\item \textbf{Creation of the repository on \textit{GitHub}.}

In order to organize the tasks and centralize the project materials, a repository was created on \textit{GitHub}, available at:

\textcolor{blue}{\href{https://github.com/lucasamtaylor01/Lorenz80_SDE}{https://github.com/lucasamtaylor01/Lorenz80\_SDE}};


Initial reading of two fundamental articles for the theoretical basis of the project: \citet{Chekroun2017} and \citet{Chekroun2021};

\item \textbf{Seminar presentation on Mori-Zwanzig Formalism.}

As part of the theoretical deepening activities, an introductory seminar on Mori-Zwanzig Formalism was prepared and presented, based on Chapter 09 of the book \textit{Stochastic Tools in Mathematics and Science} \citep{Chorin2013}.
